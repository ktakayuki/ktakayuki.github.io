<div class="title_tajima">On the Suwa method for computing versal unfoldings of codimension one  complex analytic singular foliations</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_tajima">In a series of papers, T. Suwa investigated singularities of holomorphic foliations and developed a theory of unfoldings. He gave in particular a method for computing first order versal unfoldings of codimension one local foliations and showed that a first order versal unfolding is versal. As the method given by Suwa involves several computations in local rings and modules, it is difficult in general to perform required computation in practice. 
In this talk, we consider the Suwa method from the point of view of computational complex analysis. Based on the Suwa method, we describe an algorithm for computing versal unfoldings of singular foliations. The key of our approach is the use of Grothendieck local duality on residues. </div>

<div class="title_hwang">Infinitesimal neighborhoods of submanifolds</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_hwang">We discuss the rigidity problem of infinitesimal neighborhoods of compact submanifolds of complex manifolds, which goes back to a question
 of Nirenberg and Spencer asking whether a finite-order infinitesimal neighborhood
 determines the germ of a submanifold when the normal bundle is positive.
 To study the problem for a larger class of submanifolds, we reformulate
 the problem in terms of families of infinitesimal neighborhoods of submanifolds.
 We explain some affirmative results on this reformulated problem.</div>
