<div class="title_uehara">Dynamical systems on complex surfaces</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_uehara">The entropy measures the complexity of a dynamical system, and if the entropy is positive, the system exhibits a chaotic behavior. In this talk, we consider the case where dynamical systems are given by automorphisms on compact complex surfaces, and investigate these dynamical systems in terms of entropy values.</div>

<div class="title_sera">Products of currents with analytic singularities and its application</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_sera">Since the fundamental results of Bedford and Taylor, the wedge product of closed positive currents is a central tool in complex analysis. Demailly generalized these results for currents with unbounded potentials under the assumption that the degree is small enough. To consider the wedge product of currents in arbitrary degrees, there appeared several different approaches which turned out to be not equivalent. Andersson and Wulcan presented a definition of $(dd^c \varphi)^k$ (although called Monge Amp&egrave;re operator) for arbitrary $k$ and for plurisubharmonic functions $\varphi$ with analytic singularities. Together with Blocki, they proved a mass formula for these MA operators.
In a joint work with R. L&auml;rk&auml;ng, H. Raufi &amp; E. Wulcan, we extend the definition from above to wedge products of closed positive (1,1) currents with mixed potentials. We show that these coincide with the wedge products given by Bedford-Taylor-Demailly when they are defined. Furthermore, we present a definition for mixed Monge Amp&egrave;re operators involving correction terms inspired by the mass formula mentioned above. We obtain that these so-called generalized MA products behave well under push forward. In particular, for a Griffiths semipositive singular Hermitian metric (with analytic singularities) on a vector bundle, we can define singular Chern forms which represent the Chern classes of the vector bundle.</div>

<br>
<div class="abst_inayama">Recently, Deng, Wang, Zhang, and Zhou established a new 
characterization of plurisubharmonic functions. 
They proved that an upper semi-continuous function satisfying "the 
Ohsawa-Takegoshi condition" is  plurisubharmonic. 
This condition also corresponds to positivity notions for vector bundles.
 In my talk, I will explain their works and 
compare this new positivity with classical positivity, e.g. Griffiths 
positivity or Nakano positivity. 
I would also like to talk about a partial converse of H&ouml;rmander's $L^2
$ estimate. </div>

In the first lecture, I introduce some necessary terminologies from dynamical system theory and explain the motivation to study the dynamics of polynomial diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$. In the second lecture, I introduce the key notion “crossed mapping condition” and apply it to establish a criterion for hyperbolicity as well as to analyze the dynamics restricted to the real part $\mathbb{R}^2$.</div>

<div class="title_yoshikawa">Singular varieties admitting a polarized endomorphism</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_yoshikawa">To study singular varieties admitting an endomorphism is very important for study of smooth varieties admitting an endomorphism. For example, a polarized endomorphism induces the endomorphism of the affine cone, but it has bad singularities in general. Moreover, running MMP for the smooth variety admitting a polarized endomorphism, this endomorphism induces the endomorphism of varieties appearing in any step of MMP, but in general, the varieties are not smooth. Affine cones and MMP are crucial tools for classification of projective varieties.

First, we prove that the bad singular locus is totally invariant, so the global endomorphism induces the local endomorphism at the generic point of this locus. Furthermore, we introduce related results.

Next, we consider singular surfaces admitting a polarized endomorphism by using MMP. It is very useful by studying 3-folds admitting a polarized endomorphism.</div>

iterations of self-maps on algebraic varieties (defined over number fields, 
finite fields, $p$-adic fields, function fields, etc.).  One important tool is 
height function, including Weil height, canonical height, and local height. In this

are used in theorems and conjectures in arithmetic dynamics, especially focusing on 
Zariski-density and integral points.</div>

<br>
<div class="abst_oguiso">According to Professor Igor Dolgachev, it has been a long 
standing problem if there is a smooth projective surface such that the 
automorphism group is discrete and non-finitely generated and/or it has 
infinitely many non-isomorphic real forms. <br>
<br>
In this talk, I would like to show the following answers:<br>
<br>
1) There is a smooth complex projective surface, birational to some K3 
surface, such that the automorphism group is (discrete and) non-finitely 
generated and with infinitely many non-isomorphic real forms (joint work 
with Professor Dinh).<br>

2) Over $k$, there is a smooth projective surface birational to some K3 
surface, such that the automorphism group is (discrete and) non-finitely 
generated. <br>

3) Over $k_0$, there is not a smooth projective surface birational to 
some K3 surface, such that the automorphism group is (discrete and) non-
finitely generated.  <br>
<br>
Here $k$ (resp. $k_0$) is any algebraically closed field of odd 
characteristic of transcendental degree $\ge 1$, possibly infinite, (
resp. $0$) over the prime field.   </div>

<div class="abst_shibata">Let us consider a projective variety over a number field and a morphism from the variety to itself. Then our main interest is the growth of the height of a point along the iteration of the action of the morphism to the point. The notion of arithmetic degree is a quantity which measures the growth. Canonical height functions are normalizations of usual height functions which reflects the dynamics of the morphism. In this talk, I will explain these notions, relationships between them, and related conjectures and results.</div>
