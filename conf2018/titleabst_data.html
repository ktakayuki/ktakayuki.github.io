<div class="title_sera">Chern forms of singular metrics on vector bundles</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_sera">After recalling the notion of Segre and Chern forms for smooth metrics, we would like to present some results of a joint work with Richard L&aumlrk&aumlng, Hossein Raufi and Jean Ruppenthal, where we study singular Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles. Although it is in general not possible to define the curvature as a current with measure coefficients, we give a definition of Chern forms as closed currents of order 0. For Griffiths positive/negative singular metrics, we can define these Chern currents up to the degree less or equal than the codimension of the singular locus using pluripotential theoretical methods. Finally, we will discuss some properties of these Chern currents, for instance that they represent the Chern classes of the vector bundle.</div>

<br>
<div class="abst_nakamura">Generalized K&aumlhler Einstein metrics, introduced by Mabuchi in 2000, is a generalization of K&aumlhler Einstein metrics for Fano manifolds with non vanishing Futaki invariant. (Some people called them Mabuchi metrics or Mabuchi Einstein metrics or Mabuchi soliton... We should fix the name.) In this talk, We give a complete criterion for the existence of generalized K&aumlhler Einstein metrics on toric Fano manifolds from view points of a uniform stability in a sense of GIT and the properness of a functional on the space of K&aumlhler metrics. This talk is based on arXiv:1706.01608 (to appear in Tohoku Math J.).</div>

<div class="abst_delcroix">Spherical varieties form a very large class of almost-homogeneous varieties and as such a promising class on which one can study existence of canonical metrics. However it is very difficult to do K&aumlhler geometry in a uniform way on all spherical varieties. I will introduce a subclass containing homogeneous toric bundles and group compactifications on which I am able to adapt toric geometry techniques to obtain a combinatorial sufficient criterion of properness of Mabuchi's K-energy functional. I will also present applications to existence of cscK and log-K&aumlhler-Einstein metrics.</div>

<br>
<div class="abst_huynh">Let $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ be an entire holomorphic curve and let $\{L_i\}_{1\leq i\leq q}$ be a family of $q\geq 4 $ lines in general position in projective plane. If $f$ is linearly nondegenerate, i.e. its image is not contained in any line, then the classical Second Main Theorem of Cartan states that the following inequality holds true outside a subset of $(0,\infty)$ of finite Lebesgue measure: \[ (q-3)\,T_f(r) \leq \sum_{i=1}^qN_f^{[2]}(r,L_i) + o(T_f(r)). \] Here $T_f(r)$ and $N_f^{[2]}(r,L_i)$ stand for the order function and the $2$-truncated counting functions in Nevanlinna theory. It is conjectured that in the above estimate, the truncation level of the counting functions can be decreased to $1$, provided that that $f$ is algebraically nondegenerate (i.e. its image is not contained in any algebraic curve). In this talk, we will provide a partial answer to this conjecture and propose a strategy to achieve the full proof.</div>

A calculation of their period maps shows that such K3 surfaces constitute a large family, including non-projective K3 surfaces. Furthermore, we comment on a relation with automorphisms of K3 surfaces having positive entropy. This is a joint work in progress with T. Koike.</div>
