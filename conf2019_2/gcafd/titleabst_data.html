<div class="title_tajima">On the Suwa method for computing versal unfoldings of codimension one  complex analytic singular foliations</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_tajima">In a series of papers, T. Suwa investigated singularities of holomorphic foliations and developed a theory of unfoldings. He gave in particular a method for computing first order versal unfoldings of codimension one local foliations and showed that a first order versal unfolding is versal. As the method given by Suwa involves several computations in local rings and modules, it is difficult in general to perform required computation in practice. 
In this talk, we consider the Suwa method from the point of view of computational complex analysis. Based on the Suwa method, we describe an algorithm for computing versal unfoldings of singular foliations. The key of our approach is the use of Grothendieck local duality on residues. </div>

<br>
<div class="abst_hwang">We discuss the rigidity problem of infinitesimal neighborhoods of compact submanifolds of complex manifolds, which goes back to a question
 of Nirenberg and Spencer asking whether a finite-order infinitesimal neighborhood
 determines the germ of a submanifold when the normal bundle is positive.
 To study the problem for a larger class of submanifolds, we reformulate
 the problem in terms of families of infinitesimal neighborhoods of submanifolds.
 We explain some affirmative results on this reformulated problem.</div>

<div class="title_matsumura">On projective manifolds with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_matsumura">In this talk, I explain the geometry of a projective manifold (more generally a Kaehler manifold) X  
with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature.
I first show that, if X has positive holomorphic sectional curvature,
then X is rationally connected, that is, arbitrary two points can be connected by a rational curve (the image of P^1 by a holomorphic map).
This result gives an affirmative solution for Yau's conjecture
(which was proved by Yang).  
Moreover, I show that, if X has semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature,
X admits a locally trivial morphism from X to Y such that the fiber F is rationally connected and the image Y has a finite etale cover by an abelian variety A.
This structure theorem can be seen as a generalization of the structure theorem
proved by Howard-Smyth-Wu and Mok for holomorphic "bisectional" curvature.
The proof depends on the theory of holomorphic foliations. MRC fibrations, and singular hermitian metrics. </div>

<div class="title_stolovitch">Linearizations of neighborhoods of embedded of complex compact manifolds and foliations</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_stolovitch">In this work, we address the following question due to Grauert: Let C be complex compact manifold embedded into two complex manifolds M and N. Assume  a neighbourhood of C in M is  formally equivalent to a neighborhood of C in N. Are they biholomorphically equivalent ?
If C is embedded in M, then it is also embedded, as the zero section,  into the normal bundle of C in M. We shall give conditions that ensure that a neighborhood of C in the first one is biholomorphic to a neighborhood  of C int the second.
We also prove the existence of a holomorphic foliation in M  having C  as a compact leaf, extending Ueda’s theory to the high codimension case. The solution to this problem involves "small divisors problems". This is joint work with X. Gong (Univ. Wisconsin-Madison). </div>

<br>
<div class="abst_okuyama">For a rational function on the Riemann sphere,
if its degree is more than 1, then there is the unique balanced probability measure on the Riemann sphere which has no mass on the exceptional set. When this rational function is a polynomial, Brolin constructed such a unique balanced probability measure as the harmonic measure of the Julia set with pole at infinity. In this talk,
we establish a generalization of the converse of Brolin's theorem,including a potential theoretic characterizaion of polynimials among rational functions, in an optimal form. This talks is based on a joint work with Ma&lstrok;gorzata Stawiska.

<div class="abst_ueda">We study function theoretic properties of holomorphic $\mathbb{C}$-bundles $X$ over compact K&auml;hler manifolds $M$
in the case where the (real) first Chern class of the associated line bundle vanishes.
We give a precise restriction from below on the growth rate of nonconstant plurisubharmonic functions on $X$.
This is proved by utilizing a real analytic foliation with holomorphic leaves on $X$.
If $M$ is of dimension $1$, there exists a strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function on $X$ of minimal growth.  
On the other hand, if $M$ is
of dimension $\geq 2$, then $X$ is not Stein.  This talk is based on a joint work with T. Koike.</div>

<br>
<div class="abst_adachi">In function theory on Levi-flat manifolds, the transverse regularity of leafwise holomorphic functions is a subtle problem. 
It was shown by Ohsawa and Sibony that a compact Levi-flat manifold equipped with a leafwise positive line bundle enjoys certain Sobolev estimate of finite order for the complex Green operator, and it can be embedded in a projective space by a leafwise holomorphic map with finite transverse regularity. 
In this talk, we shall refine the estimate of Ohsawa and Sibony by using the d'Angelo 1-form, and show that the refined estimate is sharp in general by giving an example where better estimates must fail.</div>
