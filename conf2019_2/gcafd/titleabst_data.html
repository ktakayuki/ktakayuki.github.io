<div class="title_tajima">On the Suwa method for computing versal unfoldings of codimension one  complex analytic singular foliations</div>
<br>
<div class="abst_tajima">In a series of papers, T. Suwa investigated singularities of holomorphic foliations and developed a theory of unfoldings. He gave in particular a method for computing first order versal unfoldings of codimension one local foliations and showed that a first order versal unfolding is versal. As the method given by Suwa involves several computations in local rings and modules, it is difficult in general to perform required computation in practice. 
In this talk, we consider the Suwa method from the point of view of computational complex analysis. Based on the Suwa method, we describe an algorithm for computing versal unfoldings of singular foliations. The key of our approach is the use of Grothendieck local duality on residues. </div>
